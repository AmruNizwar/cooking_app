With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home. My second crop of corn is about to come in and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in the near future.",,Beverages,"Mexican, Free Of..., Weeknight, Easy","1 1/2, 1, 1","piloncillo cone, Nottingham dry yeast",,,21.1,0.3,0,0,3.6,2.7,1.5,0,2.7,,1 batch,"Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160°F., We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon. We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied., Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora., Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case, we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body., 
Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping, I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row? In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes., 
Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with., Facil (easy - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor., Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off., 
Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling., Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom., This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted. The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens., Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles., 
Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash., Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed. Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern, George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn., 
This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures., This could probably be sparged as usual."

There are other  methods of seasoning and roasting but we are always satisfied with the results  this way., Try to buy a whole fillet that is already \peeled \ ( trimmed of  silverskin, fat etc.  or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it  yourself., The whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail  and when you  roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even  piece of meat for  roasting., 
If the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut  the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together., Make sure the  meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also  helps with tenderness., Rub oil ( we prefer olive  over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. The Montreal  Steak Seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections  of supermarkets  ., Or other people prefer to coat the filet with Dijon mustard  and then roll the filet in  finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting., 
Both ways are delicious., Place the filet on a  roasting rack over the  roasting pan., You can also place the filet over some beef bones in the pan which also act as a rack., Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F., Place the prepared filet on the rack and  roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- . Then decrease the temperature to 350F and roast an additional 20 minutes., Remove the filet from the oven and let  sit about 15 minutes before slicing., This total time factor  should produce  medium rare.  A heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a  smaller roast less time. The sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc.    If you prefer you can  check and rely on a meat  thermometer to test so you don't under or over roast the meat.., 
Insert  thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. Generally 120 to 130 F is rare  and 130 to 140 F is medium rare. Remember the meat will continue to cook with  \standing time\ out of the oven., Meanwhile make the mushroom sauce ( this is a natural and not thickened sauce . In a large skillet over medium high heat cook the onion in some olive oil or butter until softened., Add the sliced mushrooms  and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have reduced in  volume by 1/2 and become tender., 
Add the vermouth, dashes of Worcestershire  sauce and Gravy Master (  a browning/ caramelized color for sauces etc. . Cook  and stir  another 5 to 10 minutes and then season to taste.   If you wish you   may add a few tablespoons of the pan drippings or a bit of beef bullion paste (  available in jars  for a richer flavor., The whole recipe really can serve  quite a lot depending on how thick or thin you slice the meat. Leftovers reheat  well."

Continue to stir with the wooden  spoon while the panade dries out. This will take about 5 minutes, and a  thin crust will form on the bottom of the pan., This is supposed to  happen, so don't worry about it, and don't try to scrape it up and  incorporate it into the dough, or you will have plaster chips in your  pastries., 
The dough should be soft, but when you pinch it between thumb  and forefinger it should not stick to your hand., Dump the panade into a  bowl, and let it cool for at least 5 minutes., Then add the eggs, one at a  time, beating well after each addition., The mixture should be smooth and  creamy looking before you add the next egg., After all 4 eggs have been  beaten in, the dough will be shiny and satiny yellow, thick and heavy., Butter and flour a cookie sheet. Fill a pastry bag with the dough., 
If you  don't have a pastry bag, you can use a tablespoon to drop dollops of  dough onto the cookie sheet for eclairs and/or cream puffs, but you  really must have a pastry bag in order to make a cream puff ring., For cream puffs, Squeeze out balls about the size of ping pong or golf  balls., For eclairs, squeeze out oblongs at 3 to 4 inches long., If you are using  the recipe given above, you should end up with 14 to 16 pastries., Don't  succumb to the temptation to make fewer and larger ones, for they won't  cook properly if you do., 
Brush the tops of the pastries with beaten egg,  using the bristles of the brush to gently push down and flatten out the  little curlicues left by the pastry bag as you lifted it off., Finally,  drag the tines of a dinner fork down the length of each eclair., The  resulting stripes will make for a more attractive and professional  looking product. For a cream puff ring, first mark a 10\ circle on the surface of the  buttered and floured cookie sheet. Then, using a pastry gab, squeeze out  a 1\ wide \halo\ of cream puff paste right on top of the circle you've  outlined., 
Squeeze another 1\ wide ring of dough adjacent to - and  touching - the first. Squeeze a third ring directly over the \crack\  between the other two., Brush the whole thing with beaten egg, and  sprinkle a handful of thinly sliced almonds all over the top of the ring., Let the cream puffs, eclairs, or cream puff ring sit and \dry\ for no  less than 15 and no more than 25 minutes before baking., The oven should  be preheated to 375F for cream puffs and/or eclairs, and to 400F for a  cream puff ring., 
Bake the former at 375F for about 30 minutes, or until  they have puffed up nicely and turned golden brown., Bake the latter at  400F for about 45 minutes, or until it is well puffed and golden brown., Then, turn the oven off, open the door, and leave it halfway open for an  hour., If it won't stay ajar by itself, prop it open by wedging something  in there. This is to allow steam to escape and to let the pastries cool  slowly and \dry\ as they cool so that they won't collapse or become soft  and soggy., 
After an hour has passed, remove the pastries from the oven., They are now ready to be filled., To fill individual pastries: Cut cream puffs and eclairs in half (from side to side, not from top to  bottom. Fill with whatever filling you desire. Replace lids., Glaze with  icing or pour sauce on top., Serve. It is wise not to fill pastries to far  in advance of the serving time. The closer the preparation time is to the  serving time, the smaller the likelihood that the pastries will begin to  soften or get soggy., 
To fill a cream ring:  Use a slicing knife with a long serrated blade to cut the top off a cream  puff ring., Fill the bottom with praline cream (or coffee cream, or  chocolate cream filling., Fill a pastry bag with sweetened whipped cream., use a nozzle with a zigzag edge (like pinking shears to squeeze out a  layer of fancy puff-balls of whipped cream all over the layer of praline  cream filling., Finally, replace the lid and dust the top with 10X  powdered confectioners' sugar., Keep the cream puff ring in a cool dry  place until serving time.                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                     *  Exported from  MasterCook  *                            PRALINE FILLING Recipe By     : Homemade Good News (Vol 3 No 3 Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00 Categories    : Pastries Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method --------  ------------  --------------------------------  1      cup           10X powdered confectioners' sugar    1/2  cup           almonds Make the vanilla custard cream.,

2496,Dark Chocolate Cake,1535,Marg CaymanDesigns,50M,10M,1H,1999-10-23T12:27:00Z,"While it takes slightly longer to prepare this recipe than a box mix, the resulting moist, delicious cake makes it VERY worth the little extra time. I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version. (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake. I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.
My father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. 
(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. I would recommend using their Special Dark Cocoa if possible.","https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/WnJFBuTMQEj2PNZ1hLwg_batch23-7154.jpg, https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/v1/img/feed/2496/ujrrQ86xQ8esU3YsXoyo_DarkChocCake.jpg, https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/qg1ylT80TMGWTf1OrBAj_IMG_1461.JPG, https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/24/96/Y9iikuBR2SyunbnXkWSm_IMG_20140814_145156.jpg,

NOTE: I have tried it with 1/2 cup, 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup boiling water and we prefer it with less than 1 cup water. I usually use between 2/3 & 3/4 cups. The cake is still very moist but it doesn't seem to \fall\ as much as it cools. This might have to do with our high humidity or brand of flour or other factors so I don't know if it will work for everyone., 
Pour into prepared pan., Bake 30 to 35 minutes for round 9-inch pans, 35 to 40 minutes for rectangular pan or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. (Do not use 8-inch pans or the batter will overflow.., Because they have a tendency to overflow if you fill them more than 2/3 full, I usually get about 27-28 cupcakes per batch. Bake for approximately 18-20 minutes., Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to wire racks., Please note: baking cocoa isn't hot chocolate drink mix! Baking cocoa contains no sugar and it is found on the baking aisle. Chocolate drink mixes that you add to milk or water to drink WILL NOT work in this recipe.

The  potatoes may be quite  brown by this time and the chops should be getting softer and ready to  cut with a fork., 
Add a little more water if needed., If the   potatoes and chops still aren't done enough, just turn up the heat  and cook a  little more. Drain all the juice from the can of sauerkraut  and spread over the potatoes., Sprinkle liberally with brown  sugar., Check often during the next 15  minutes to see when the  brown sugar melts., Mix it around into the kraut and  potatoes  and flip  the chops around to get some too., The dish is done when the  chops tear apart to a fork and potatoes are soft.

The following recipe is typical but far   from definitive, especially where the ingredients   for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use   whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or   your conscience dictates. Certainly if anyone were to insist that   'Maultaschen' were the most delicious of all Swabian   specialties, I[rst Scharfenberg] would hardly be   prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier, I   suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good   chances in a four-way international competition with   ravioli, won tons, and pirogi for the champion- ship   of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with Meat (plus   Miscellaneous Filling division.",,Lunch/Snacks,"Pork, Meat, German, European, < 15 Mins, Stove Top","2 3/4, 4, NA, 1, 6, 3, 1/4, 1, 1/2, 1/2, 1, 3, 3, NA, NA, 1, 3","flour, eggs, salt, butter, bacon, onions, sausage, spinach, Farmer's sausage, eggs, parsley, salt, pepper, egg, milk",4,2,723.2,28.1,10.1,405.9,660.4,85.1,5.4,4.6,30.7,4,,"Combine the flour, eggs, and salt in a bowl and mix to   make a pasta dough., Then add a little water and knead   until it has a firm but elastic consistency., To make the filling, melt the butter in a skillet and   fry the bacon with the onions until both are quite   translucent.  Combine the bacon mixture with the   sausage meat.   Moisten the hard roll in water, press dry, and put   through the meat grinder (better than the food mill or   food processor, along with the bacon mixture, cooked   spinach, ground meat or smoked farm sausage, leftover   roast, etc.  Then fold in the eggs, parsley, and   seasonings; mix together., 
The filling should be very   spicy indeed., On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll   out the dough into rectangular sheets (about twice as   wide as you want your 'Maultaschen' to be.  Take a   tablespoon measure and put little dabs of filling at   equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the middle of   one side of the sheet of dough., Mix together the egg   and canned milk and apply it to the spaces in between,   the outer edge and the fold line.  Fold the plain half   of the sheet of dough over to cover the filling, press   down firmly on the spaces around the little packets of   filling, and use a pastry wheel or knife to separate   the packets into 3-inch square or diamond- shaped   'Maultaschen'., 
The process is similar to making   ravioli., Cook thoroughly in beef stock or boiling   salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes, depending   upon the size of the 'Maultaschen'., They'll bob up to   the surface when they're done; remove them with a   slotted spoon and allow to drain., Serving suggestions:   Cut an onion or two into half-rings, fry in butter   until golden brown and empty the contents of the   skillet over the 'Maultaschen' on the serving dish., Serve with slippery potato salad or a mixed green   salad.

The recipe may seem like a lot of spices, but they lose their strength when mixed with all that stuff and cooked., 
Serve with lemon or lime wedges, some more habenero sauce, and plenty of cold beverages., And be careful with that hot oil. Excessive alcohol consumption and playing around with hot oil definitely do NOT mix., Enjoy! PS: If you don't want to make these fritters but you are in Florida, the best that I HAVE found in a re staurant are at the Calpyso Restaurant and Raw Bar in Pompano., (I have no connection other than I have been a  good customer there since 1990 and I think the owners are great folks.

Rinse chard leaves and cut off any stem., Stack chard leaves in a steamer basket or metal colander over a large kettle of  boiling water: cover., Allow leaves to steam 3-4 minutes or until soft and  pliable but  still quite green., After 2 minutes of steaming you can  use two  spatulas to turn the whole stack of leaves over to allow the \less cooked\ ones  on the top to steam more thoroughly., Remove chard leaves to a plate.  Separate  them and allow  them to cool so they will be easier to handle.  Flatten a chard  leaf on the working surface and place about 2 tablespoons of chosen filling  1/2 inch above the bottom stem end., 
Fold each side over the filling, then roll up  from the stem end \burrito style\, ending with the top of the leaf folded over  the roll., Place the dolmade \leaf-tip-side-down\ in the tomato juice in the  prepared pan., You should be able to see the roll, but not any of the seam, which should be underneath., I differentiate the vegetarian and meat dolmades by  placing a sliver of carrot or red pepper on top of the vegetarian ones., Repeat  with all of the remaining leaves., If you tear a leaf and can't use it or have  extra filling left over, you can sprinkle it into the tomato juice when you bake the dish and your sauce will be all the more delicious., 
Pour remaining tomato  juice over the dolmades., Two cooking methods: Bake in a moderate 350 degree oven for 35 minutes on the top shelf, uncovered., or Simmer in a large stew pot on top of the stove.  If you choose this method,  weight the dolmades down by placing a plate on top of them and then putting  something  heavy (i.e. a heavy coffee mug or two on top of the plate. Simmer at  low-medium heat on stove top for 20-25 minutes., This method produces a more  compact dolmade that holds together better when you serve it.
